### About
BlackEagle is a parental control system that helps parents monitor their children's computers and reduce their exposure to content that is not appropriate for their age, while putting great emphasis on increased security and privacy of the information stored on our system.

The system consists of three parts:
* Remote server developed using Spring-Boot in conjunction with Apache-Tomcat server software.
* C / C ++ spyware that is responsible for collecting data from the monitored computer and keeping it on a remote server securely.
* A WEB interface developed using React-Native that allows remote access to data collected from a remote computer, in order to detect inappropriate content.
